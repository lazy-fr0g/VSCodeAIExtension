## Overview
This project is an AI-powered compatibility module designed for Visual Studio. It enhances the development experience by improving compatibility checks across different operating systems and optimizing dependency resolution within the Visual Studio environment.

## Features
- **Cross-platform OS compatibility checks** (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **AI-powered dependency resolution** for improved stability
- **Enhanced error handling** and **logging mechanisms**
- **Optimized memory usage** and **performance improvements**
- **Support for additional OSType variants**
- **Seamless integration with Visual Studio extensions**

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:

   ```

## Usage
This module integrates with Visual Studio to provide AI-powered compatibility analysis. To use it within your extension:
- Import the compatibility service:
  ```typescript
  import { DotNetCompatibilityService } from './extensions/core_extension';
  ```
- Check OS compatibility:
  ```typescript
  const compatibilityService = new DotNetCompatibilityService();
  console.log(compatibilityService.isSupported());
  ```
